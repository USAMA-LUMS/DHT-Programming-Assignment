# DHT-Programming-Assignment
An assignment on Distributed Hash Table (in Python) with automated test cases, I made for an undergrad networks course.

## What the assignment covers?
- Assignment requires students to construct a simple lookup mechanism (could be chord based as well as sequential lookup).
- Mechanism to join and leave the DHT.
- Mechanism to put and get files from the DHT.
- Failure tolerance with a replication factor of one.

Here is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/7oeJFxVYq9c).
Other details can be found in the `Manual.pdf`.
